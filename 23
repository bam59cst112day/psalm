Time is my nemesis; It burgles my soul.
2     those hours, minutes, and seconds -- pilfer my very being.
Thou dost oppress me incessantly, despite still waters.
3     I shall not rest.
Thou leadest me in paths of [obsessive] punctuality,
    for Time's sake.
4 Yea though I walk through the valley of life in the shadow of clocks,
    there is no respite from thy wrath:
Thou dost mercilessly harrass me;
    thy ticks and thy tocks,
    they torture me.
    
5 Thou preparest a schedule before me
    in the pressure of deadlines;
Thou assaulteth my head with alarums;
    my nerves overflow.
6 Surely the anxiety of thy demands shall haunt me
    all the days of my life,
And I shall stress & fret in the clutches of chronic promptitude
    forever.

        "Nevermore"

        Tempis Fug It!
