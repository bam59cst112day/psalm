Time is my nemesis; I shall not rest.
2     thy hours, minutes, and seconds -- pilfer my very being.
Thou dost oppress me incessantly, despite still waters.
3     It burgles my soul.
Thou leadest me in paths of punctuality,
    for Time's sake.
4 Yea though I walk through the valley of life in the shadow of clocks,
    there is no respite from thy wrath:
thou dost mercilessly harrass me;
    thy ticks and thy tocks,
    they torture me.
5 Thou preparest a schedule before me
    in the pressure of deadlines;
thou assaulteth my head with alarums;
    my nerves overflow.
6 Surely ???pressure and pain shall follow me
    all the days of my life,
and I shall stress & fret in the clutches of ???
    forever.
