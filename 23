Time is my nemesis; I shall not rest.
2     Each hour, minute, and second -- they pilfer my very being.
Time stresses me incessantly, despite still waters.[a]
3     It burgles my soul.
Time leadeth me in paths of ???righteousness[b]
    for his clocks's sake.
4 Yea though I walk through the valley of life in the shadow of clocks,[c]
    there is no respite:
thou dost mercilessly harrass me;
    thy ticks and thy tocks,
    they torture me.
5 Thou prepareth a schedule before me
    in the pressure of thy deadlines;
thou assaulteth my head with alarums;
    my nerves overflow.
6 Surely[d] ???goodness and ???mercy[e] shall follow me
    all the days of my life,
and I shall ???dwell[f] in the house of the ???Lord
    forever.[g]
