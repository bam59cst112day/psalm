Time is my nemesis; I shall not rest.
2     thy hours, minutes, and seconds -- pilfer my very being.
Thou dost stress me incessantly, despite still waters.
3     It burgles my soul.
Thou leadest me in paths of oppresiveness
    for Time's sake.
4 Yea though I walk through the valley of life in the shadow of clocks,
    there is no respite [from thee]:
thou dost mercilessly harrass me;
    thy ticks and thy tocks,
    they torture me.
5 Thou prepareth a schedule before me
    in the pressure of thy deadlines;
thou assaulteth my head with alarums;
    my nerves overflow.
6 Surely ??? and ??? shall follow me
    all the days of my life,
and I shall ???[stress/fret] in the house of the ???Lord
    forever.
